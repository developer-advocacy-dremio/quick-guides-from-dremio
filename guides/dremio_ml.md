## Using Dremio for Machine Learning

In this scenario we assume your data has already been prepared on Dremio, we then pull the data using dremio-simple-query into a notebook to train a model.

```py
from dremio_simple_query.connect import DremioConnection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import pandas as pd
from os import getenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Establish connection to Dremio
token = getenv("TOKEN")
uri = getenv("ARROW_ENDPOINT")
dremio = DremioConnection(token, uri)

# Query data
df = dremio.toPandas("SELECT * FROM your_data_table;")

# Preprocess data (assuming df is already preprocessed for simplicity)

# Split data
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['target_column']  # Target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```
## Understanding the Example Code

```py
from dremio_simple_query.connect import DremioConnection
```
This line imports the DremioConnection class from the dremio_simple_query.connect module, which is used to establish a connection to a Dremio data source using the Arrow Flight protocol.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
Imports the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. This function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

Imports the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model. This class is a machine learning model that will be used to perform linear regression.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

Imports the mean_squared_error function from sklearn.metrics. This function is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model by calculating the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Imports the Pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. It is used here to handle the dataset in DataFrame format.

```python
from os import getenv
```

Imports the getenv function from the os module. This function is used to retrieve environment variables.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

Imports the load_dotenv function from the dotenv module. This function loads environment variables from a .env file into the script, making it easier to manage sensitive information like API tokens.

```python
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
```

Calls the load_dotenv() function to load environment variables from the .env file.

```python
# Establish connection to Dremio
token = getenv("TOKEN")
uri = getenv("ARROW_ENDPOINT")
dremio = DremioConnection(token, uri)
```

Retrieves the Dremio personal access token and the Arrow Flight endpoint URI from environment variables and uses them to establish a connection to Dremio.

```python
# Query data
df = dremio.toPandas("SELECT * FROM your_data_table;")
```

Executes a SQL query against the Dremio data source and retrieves the results as a Pandas DataFrame. This is done using the toPandas method of the DremioConnection object.

```python
# Preprocess data (assuming df is already preprocessed for simplicity)
```
A placeholder comment indicating where data preprocessing steps (like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.) would go. This example assumes that the clean up work has been prior from Dremio).

```python
# Split data
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['target_column']  # Target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
Prepares the dataset for machine learning by separating it into features (X) and the target variable (y). It then uses train_test_split to divide the data into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data used for testing.

```python
# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Initializes a LinearRegression model and fits it to the training data. This "training" process involves finding the best coefficients for the features in X_train to predict y_train.

```python
# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset (X_test). The mean squared error between the predictions and the actual values (y_test) is calculated and printed. This evaluates how well the model has learned to predict the target variable.
Each line of this code contributes to a workflow for querying data from Dremio, preparing it for machine learning, training a model, and evaluating its performance.
